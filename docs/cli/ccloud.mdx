# cCloud

Using the `ccloud-setup` tool to initialize a new project.

:::info
The `ccloud` tool is still under development.
There may be bugs and missing features, which [you can help](https://github.com/CactiveNetwork/cloud-docs/issues) to remedy!
:::

## Install cCloud

```sh
$ npm install --global ccloud
```

## Initialize in the current directory
```sh
$ ccloud init
```

:::tip
After running the init command, you will need to connect your account if not already connected, and select the project you wish to target.
:::

## Deploy
To deploy your project, or updates to said project, run the following command:

```sh
$ ccloud deploy
```

This runs the `build_command` script, and uploads the resulting `build_file`.
These options are defined in your [cloud.config.json](/docs/cli/cloud-config)
